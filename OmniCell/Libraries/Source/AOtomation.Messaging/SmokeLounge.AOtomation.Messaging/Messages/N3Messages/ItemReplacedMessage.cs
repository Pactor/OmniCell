    /// Three fields and all three are named by the one call the dispatcher
    /// makes. Reader 0x10003EDC, writer 0x10003F19, dispatcher 0x10003F4D,
    /// vtable 0x10155D74; the reader takes an int32 and then two ACGItem_ts
    /// through GameData's own stream operator, and the writer puts back the
    /// same three.
    ///
    /// The dispatcher resolves the message's identity to a character, takes
    /// that character's inventory at +0x1B8, and hands it the three fields at
    /// 0x1004D44C. That function refuses a slot above 0x3F, which is what makes
    /// the int32 a placement; it asks n3Dynel_t::IsClientChar whether this is
    /// our own character, and if it is, it reads what is actually in the slot
    /// and compares it against the third field, doing nothing when they already
    /// match - so the third field is what the slot should end up holding. If it
    /// is somebody else's character it cannot look, and uses the second field
    /// as what was there before. Then it clears the slot at 0x1004D4EE and puts
    /// the third field in at 0x1004D502.

    /// No capture contains one.
