    /// Reader 0x100041CB, writer 0x100040C2, dispatcher 0x10004074, vtable
    /// 0x10155DB0. The reader takes an X3F1 list of Vector3s through the helper
    /// at 0x10004296 and then one float; the writer emits the same two.
    ///
    /// The dispatcher resolves the message&#39;s identity with GetDynel and
    /// casts it to a Vehicle_t - by way of CharVehicle_t - which is the first
    /// thing worth knowing: this message is for vehicles, not for characters on
    /// foot. It then calls virtual slot 0x64 with the list and the float, and
    /// Vehicle.dll exports the name of that slot:
    /// Vehicle_t::UseWaypointPath(vector&lt;Vector3_t&gt; const&amp;, float) at
    /// 0x1000CDE1.
    ///
    /// What the float is comes out of what UseWaypointPath builds with it. The
    /// path object&#39;s constructor at 0x1000F412 keeps it at +0x14, walks the
    /// waypoints adding up the total length into +0x20, and then sets
    /// +0x18 = length / float. The path&#39;s own evaluator at 0x1000F37F is
    /// handed a time: it compares that time against +0x18 and returns the last
    /// waypoint once it is past it, and otherwise multiplies +0x1C by the time
    /// to get a distance along the route. So +0x18 is how long the path takes,
    /// and length divided by the float being a time makes the float a speed.
    ///
    /// SimpleCharFullUpdate carries a path too, and it is not this one: see
    /// <see cref="GameData.WaypointPath"/>, which has an Identity in front, a
    /// plain int32 count rather than the X3F1 form, and no speed.
