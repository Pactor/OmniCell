    /// Five fields, and one call names all five. Reader 0x10076C2A, writer
    /// 0x10076C83, dispatcher 0x10076CC9, vtable 0x10162280; the reader takes
    /// two Identities and three int32s - the last of which it keeps as nothing
    /// but zero-or-not - and the writer emits the same five.
    ///
    /// The dispatcher resolves the message identity to a character, takes the
    /// fight handler at character +0x1D4 - the member N3Msg_GetAttackingID,
    /// N3Msg_CanAttack and N3Msg_GetSpecialAttackWeaponName all work through -
    /// and hands it the five fields at 0x100697BD. That function splits into
    /// two halves.
    ///
    /// The ammunition half works on the character's inventory. When the flag is
    /// set it calls 0x10049391 with a slot of -1, which ends at 0x1002AB07:
    /// fetch the entry, free it, and clear the slot. When the flag is clear it
    /// calls 0x10049354, which ends at 0x1002AF06: fetch the entry at that slot
    /// and set its +2 - the count int16 every container record carries - to the
    /// int32, clamped to 0 to 0xFFFF, marking the entry changed if it moved.
    /// Either way the Identity it works from is an inventory location and not
    /// an item: both paths check that its type is between 0x65 and 0xF9, which
    /// is the range of inventory pages, and use its instance as the slot.
    ///
    /// The weapon half resolves the second Identity to a WeaponItem_t - the
    /// cast target at 0x101BFCC8 says so - reads stat 0x1A, Energy, refuses the
    /// message if it comes back negative, and sets that stat to the second
    /// int32.
