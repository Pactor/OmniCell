    /// the string PerkUpdateIIR, which is a real class name in the client, so
    /// PerkUpdate is what the client calls it. Everything it does is research.

    /// personalresearchgoal, tracks experience outstanding on a research line,
    /// and on completion sets the research window's got_tech - not got_perk,
    /// which exists two strings away. The dispatcher also gates on stat 389,
    /// expansion, at 0x10053916, which is what decides whether a character has
    /// research at all.

    /// separates a message we cannot read from one that never arrives. Two
    /// logins, a perk purchase and a levelling session produced none. Every
