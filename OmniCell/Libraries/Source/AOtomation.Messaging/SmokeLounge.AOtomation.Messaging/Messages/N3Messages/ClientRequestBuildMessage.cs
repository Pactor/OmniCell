    /// <remarks>
    /// One of the five messages the city GUI sends, all built the same way. The
    /// sender takes the city's CityAI_c, calls GetID - exported from city.dll at
    /// 0x100027E2, returning a CityID_t - and pushes that structure's +4 into
    /// the message; CityID_t opens with an Identity, read by city.dll's own
    /// identity operator at 0x100274BB, so +4 is its instance half. Nothing else
    /// of the city id goes on the wire, because the server has the rest.
    ///
    /// The client is the only source for this message: it is sent, never
    /// received - the dispatcher does nothing but clear the pass-on flag - and
    /// no capture contains one, because a capture of a city would need a city.
    /// </remarks>
    /// <remarks>
    /// The other end is city.dll's
    /// CityAI_c::ClientRequestBuild(Identity const&amp;, Identity const&amp;,
    /// TilePos_c const&amp;, int, Identity const&amp;) at 0x10002A0C. Its first
    /// argument is the requester, which the server supplies; the four after it
    /// line up one for one with the four fields that follow the city id here,
    /// in order.
    ///
    /// The signature carries no parameter names, but the sending side does. The
    /// chain is: GUI.dll 0x100E90FC takes one entry of the city window's build
    /// plan and calls ClientRequestBuild with the player's Identity, the entry's
    /// + 8, + 0x10, + 0x18 and + 0, in that order; that reaches
    /// AOCityInterfaceClient_c slot 0x140, at Gamecode 0x1012E62F, which builds
    /// this message. So the plan entry is the message, and the entry is a
    /// BaseClientHouseData_t - the struct city.dll passes to and from
    /// CityClientInterface_c::FillCityHouseDataVector.
    ///
    /// Two of the three then name themselves, because the same GUI code resolves
    /// the entry through a registry whose lookup Funcom exported. See
    /// <see cref="HouseTemplate"/> and <see cref="Rotation"/>. The third does
    /// not; see <see cref="Unknown3"/>.
