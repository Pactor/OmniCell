    /// Two fields. Reader 0x1007238B, writer 0x100723BA, dispatcher 0x100723DE,
    /// vtable 0x10161D54; the reader takes a container through the shared
    /// container reader at 0x1002A5DB - the same one FullCharacter's inventory
    /// uses - and then an int32, and the writer puts back the same two.
    ///
    /// The dispatcher resolves the message's identity to a character and then
    /// finishes the container off: it writes 0xDEAE into the container's +0x20
    /// and the int32 into its +0x24, which together are an Identity, and hangs
    /// the container on the character's inventory at +0x180. Only the instance
    /// half travels; the client supplies the type itself, which is why the wire
    /// carries a bare int32 and not an Identity.
    ///
    /// 0xDEAE is one of a run of window types the client already names -
    /// 0xDEA9 is the team window, 0xDEAA an organization, 0xDEAD the incoming
    /// trade window - and N3Msg_GetContainerInventoryList at 0x100175A6
    /// switches on exactly those four: asked about an identity of type 0xDEAE
    /// it returns 0x10046E1C, which reads the inventory's +0x180 and checks the
    /// container's +0x24 against the identity it was asked about. That closes
    /// the loop: the int32 here is what the client will later be asked for by
    /// name.
    ///
    /// The Bank message is the same container arriving the other way round: its
    /// dispatcher at 0x1007254B writes the character's own instance into +0x24
    /// instead of taking one off the wire, so Bank is your own bank and this is
    /// somebody else's.
    ///
    /// No capture contains one.
