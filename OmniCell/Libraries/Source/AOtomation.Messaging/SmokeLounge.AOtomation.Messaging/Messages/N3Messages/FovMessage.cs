    /// Thirty three bytes, always, and there is no room in it for anything
    /// conditional. The reader is at Gamecode.dll 0x10073BA2: it allocates a
    /// thirty six byte block and fills it with two floats, one byte, five more
    /// floats and an int32 - thirty six in memory rather than thirty three
    /// because of the padding after the byte, which is not on the wire. Its
    /// WriteSubClass is a bare return, so the client never sends this.
    ///
    /// The dispatcher at 0x10073C32 resolves the identity to a dynel, hands the
    /// block to the object at dynel + 0x1D8, and sets stat 533, npcfovstatus,
    /// to 1.
    ///
    /// What the block means comes from the two functions that touch it. The one
    /// that receives it, at 0x100524F4, tidies it up: it forces TurnDownSpeed
    /// and TurnUpSpeed positive, defaults TurnSpeed to TurnUpSpeed when it is
    /// zero, clamps AtLimit to 0-2, and - when SweepCentre is above zero -
    /// replaces it with the direction the NPC is actually facing and copies
    /// that into CurrentAngle.
    ///
    /// The other, at 0x10052332, is the sweep itself, run every frame:
    ///
    ///     CurrentAngle += TurnSpeed * elapsed
    ///     if (CurrentAngle left the arc SweepCentre +/- SweepHalfAngle)
    ///         do what AtLimit says
    ///
    /// and then it builds a rotation about the up axis by CurrentAngle and
    /// hands it to the dynel as its heading. So this message is an NPC turning
    /// its head back and forth, and the fields are the arc, the speed and where
    /// in the arc it currently is.
    ///
    /// The captured values agree field for field. Both NPCs carry AtLimit 0,
    /// Bounce, and their TurnSpeed is only ever plus or minus their own
    /// TurnUpSpeed - which is exactly what Bounce does and nothing else would.
    /// The angles land on whole degrees: 65 and 22.5 for the two arcs, 25 and
    /// 20 for the two speeds.
    ///
    /// 391 of these appear in a single captured mission run and not one appears
    /// in any earlier capture, because nothing before it had a pet fighting
    /// alongside NPCs that could notice it.
