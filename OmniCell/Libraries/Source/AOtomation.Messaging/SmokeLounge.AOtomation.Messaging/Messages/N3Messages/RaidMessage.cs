    /// and dispatcher 0x100A40C0. The reader takes an int16 and widens it; the
    /// writer narrows the same field back, so two bytes travel even though the
    /// client holds four. Only the value 1 carries a body, and then it is read
    /// by 0x1005731B: an int32 that must be 1 or the rest is skipped, then a
    /// plain int32 count and that many twenty byte records.
    ///
    /// The list was a dead end for a long time. It goes into +0xB8 of the
    /// object the character's world handler returns, and no export reaches it -
    /// Interfaces.dll has N3Msg_RequestRaidLocks, which asks for it, and
    /// nothing that reads it. The reader is in Gamecode after all: the same
    /// dispatcher calls 0x100430C2, which walks +0xB8 at stride 0x14 and prints
    /// a line per entry under "Raid locks:". See <see cref="GameData.RaidLock"/>
    /// for what each line is made of.
