    /// says what each of the three is, because it resolves all of them and the
    /// casts it asks for are the names. The message's own identity is resolved
    /// as a SimpleChar_t; the identity in the body as a plain n3Dynel_t; each
    /// identity in the list as a SimpleItem_t.
    ///
    /// Then it does two things per listed item. It calls
    /// n3Dynel_t::RelocateDynel on the body dynel with the item, the null
    /// position and the null rotation - so the item becomes a child of the body
    /// dynel, sitting at its origin - and it hands the same item to the
    /// character's inventory at 0x10058903, with a slot of -1 meaning anywhere.
    /// An item that was standing in the world is now hanging off something and
    /// listed in someone's inventory, which is what picking something up looks
    /// like from the outside.
    ///
    /// Reader 0x1003A61D, writer 0x1003A4EA, vtable 0x1015E4C4. The two agree
    /// field for field, and the list helper the writer uses, 0x1003A73A, emits
