    /// and dispatcher 0x10077207. The reader takes an int32, a byte, an
    /// int32 length and that many raw bytes, an Identity and a final int32; the
    /// writer emits the same six in the same order, so there are two
    /// independent sources for the layout. The only constructor, at 0x10077065,
    /// is reached from the message factory at 0x1000BDCD and nowhere else, so
    /// the client never builds one of these - the reader and the dispatcher are
    /// all there is.
    ///
    /// The dispatcher resolves the message's own identity with
    /// n3Dynel_t::GetDynel and calls 0x1005BB92 on it with the int32 and the
    /// string. That function is a four way switch on the int32, and each arm
    /// writes a different std::string on the dynel: 1 goes to +0x170, 2 to
    /// +0x18C, 3 to +0x154 and 4 to a heap string at +0x1A8, and anything else
    /// does nothing at all. Two of those four are named by exports that read
    /// them straight back - N3Msg_GetFirstName returns +0x170 at 0x10018968 and
    /// N3Msg_GetLastName returns +0x18C at 0x100189A5.
    ///
    /// <see cref="CloneMessage"/> uses slot 3, and slot 3 is the only one the
    /// client treats specially: the dispatcher first clears bit 0x40 through
    /// two virtual calls, and the store itself replaces every '/' in the string
    /// with 'X' at 0x1005BCF6, which is what a name a person typed gets.
    ///
    /// The reader refuses the whole message unless the length is between 1 and
    /// 31, so a name is at most 31 bytes and there is no terminator on the
    /// wire.
    ///
    /// No capture contains one.
