    /// Three Vector3s and nothing else. Reader 0x100774EE, writer 0x100774BC,
    /// dispatcher 0x10077527, vtable 0x10162360; the reader takes twelve floats
    /// and the writer puts back the same twelve.
    ///
    /// The dispatcher resolves the message identity to a character and copies
    /// the three vectors onto it at 0x10057777 - the first to the character's
    /// +0x224, the second to +0x230, the third to +0x23C.
    ///
    /// What the first two are for is settled by the only place that reads them
    /// back, at 0x1005ABFB, which runs every frame. It gives up at once if the
    /// vector at +0x224 is zero. Otherwise it calls
    /// VisualEnvFX_t::DisplaySyncPosition - exported from DisplaySystem.dll at
    /// 0x10060E67, taking four Vector3s - with the character's own
    /// Vehicle_t::GetGlobalPos as the first and last argument, +0x224 as the
    /// second, and +0x230 as the third; when +0x230 is zero it passes the
    /// client's own position there instead. DisplaySyncPosition draws a marker
    /// at each of the four in a different colour and joins them, and it does
    /// nothing at all unless bit 0x400 of the display flags is set - a debug
    /// overlay, which is what the message is called.
    ///
    /// So the first vector is the server's position for the character and the
    /// second is a second one it can send beside it. The third has no reader.
    /// See <see cref="Unknown1"/>.
    ///
