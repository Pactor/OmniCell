    /// ScriptIIR_t has vtable 0x1017231C, reader 0x101308EE, writer 0x10130852
    /// and dispatcher 0x10130A1B. The reader and the writer emit the same ten
    /// fields in the same order, so there are two independent sources for the
    /// layout: three int32s, a counted string, three int32s, a counted string
    /// and two int32s. Both strings go through the shared helper at 0x10038AF8,
    /// which is an int16 length and then the characters with no terminator.
    ///
    /// What the message is comes out of one import. The dispatcher builds a
    /// string from the script text and hands it to
    /// FXS_t::ExecuteScript(char const*, FXS_Object_t*) - FXS being the
    /// client's effect scripting system - and files the object that comes back
    /// in a map at 0x102EACA8 keyed by the script id. So this is the server
    /// starting, superceding and stopping visual effects by name.
    ///
    /// The clock handling at the top of the dispatcher runs for every command
    /// and is what names three of the numbers. It takes the client's own time,
    /// subtracts <see cref="ServerTime"/> from it, keeps the smallest
    /// difference it has ever seen in the static at 0x102EACA4, and adds that
    /// to <see cref="StartTime"/> - the standard trick for turning a server
    /// clock reading into a client one using the least-delayed sample. Both
    /// times are then fed into the script text, which is an LDB format
    /// template: LDBformat takes the text, Feed takes
    /// <see cref="Duration"/> and then the corrected
    /// <see cref="StartTime"/>, and Dump produces what ExecuteScript runs.
    /// Command 3 uses the same two the other way round, computing
    /// Duration - now + StartTime and handing that remaining time to the
    /// playfield with the script.

    /// No capture contains one.
