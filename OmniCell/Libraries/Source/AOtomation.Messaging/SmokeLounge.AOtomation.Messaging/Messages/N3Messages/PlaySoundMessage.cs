    /// count as an int32 and then writes that many bytes out of the string's
    /// own storage - so the NUL travels and is counted. The reader agrees: it
    /// refuses a count above 1000 or at or below zero, allocates one byte more
    /// than the count, and NUL-terminates after what it read, which is a
    /// second terminator and is why the one on the wire does no harm.
