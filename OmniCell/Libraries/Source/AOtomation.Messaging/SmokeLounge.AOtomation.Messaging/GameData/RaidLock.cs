    /// Twenty bytes, read by Gamecode 0x10057277: two Identities and an int32.
    /// The names come from the one thing that reads the list back, the
    /// renderer at 0x100430C2, which walks it at stride 0x14 and prints a line
    /// per entry under the heading "Raid locks:".
    ///
    /// That line is built as name + "(" + the first Identity's instance +
    /// "): " + the second Identity's instance + " - " + hours + "h " +
    /// minutes + "m " + seconds + "s". The name is the return of the lookup at
    /// 0x10036982, which is the whole body of the export
    /// n3EngineClientAnarchy_t::N3Msg_GetPFName(unsigned int) at 0x10016AE6 -
    /// so the first Identity is a playfield, and when the table has no entry
    /// for it the client prints "Unknown". The hours, minutes and seconds are
    /// the int32 minus the client's current time, divided by 0xE10 and then by
    /// 0x3C, which makes the int32 an absolute time rather than a duration.
